        Three months ago, our journey began, and every moment since then has been filled with love, laughter, and endless joy. Today, as we celebrate our three-month anniversary, I am reminded of how grateful I am to have you in my life. You bring light into my days and warmth into my heart.

Together, we've shared countless unforgettable memories, overcome challenges, and grown stronger with each passing day. This milestone is a testament to the love and commitment we share.

Here's to the countless adventures yet to come, the laughter we'll share, and the love that will continue to grow between us. Happy three-month anniversary, my love. I cherish every moment with you."
